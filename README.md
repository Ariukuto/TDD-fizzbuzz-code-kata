# TDD fizzbuzz Code Kata
Test Driven Development Coding Kata

## Task
- Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100
- For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number

## My reflections
- Writing a few minimal tests
- Outsource test logic to extra function
- Function should always return the same data type (String)
- Function should be passed a value of type number or integer as parameter
- Function must convert passed data type into a string
- Writing small tests step by step
- The first test must fail (red phase)
- then find the easiest solution
- then refactor the logic so that the test is successful (green phase)
